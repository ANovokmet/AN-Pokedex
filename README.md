# AnPokedex

This is my solution to the Javascript Task - "Pokémon Encyclopedia".
This project was built using Angular, using `@angular/cli` 7.0.4.

## Run

Run a server in `dist/an-pokedex` (eg. *http-server*) or run `ng serve`.

## Other options

If Angular CLI not already installed, run `npm -g @angular/cli`.

If you want to run a dev server, run `ng serve`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

To build the project run `ng build`. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
